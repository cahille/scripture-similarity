In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been.

And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \"Never mind, all is well--I am well enough off.\" I then said to my mother, \"I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\" It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?",
